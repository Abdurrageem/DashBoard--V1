## ?? How It Works

### Automatic Seeding:
The database seeds automatically when you start the app:

```csharp
// In Program.cs
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var seeder = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDatabaseSeederService>();
    await seeder.SeedDatabaseAsync();
}
```

### Smart Seeding:
- ? Only seeds if database is empty
- ? Checks for existing data first
- ? Logs all seeding operations
- ? Transactions ensure data integrity

### One-Time Only:
- Seeds on **first run** only
- Won't re-seed on subsequent starts
- Safe to restart app multiple times

---

## ?? Technical Details

### Service: `DatabaseSeederService.cs`
**Interface:** `IDatabaseSeederService`

**Methods:**
- `SeedDatabaseAsync()` - Main seeding method
- `IsDatabaseSeededAsync()` - Checks if already seeded

**Features:**
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling with try-catch
- Realistic South African data
- Proper date/time handling
- Related data consistency

### Seed Order (Important!):
1. Companies (no dependencies)
2. Users (depends on Companies)
3. Drivers (depends on Users)
4. Dispatchers (depends on Users)
5. Deliveries (depends on Drivers)
6. Panic Alerts (depends on Drivers)
7. Risk Zones (independent)
8. Safety Scores (depends on Drivers)
9. Location Updates (depends on Drivers)

## ?? Data Details

### Johannesburg Coordinates:
- Base Latitude: `-26.2041`
- Base Longitude: `28.0473`
- Random variations: ±0.05 degrees

### Timestamps:
- Today's data: `DateTime.Today`
- Recent data: Last 7 days
- Active alerts: Last 10 minutes
- Historical: Up to 6 days ago

### Status Values:
- **Driver Status:** Active, OnBreak, Offline
- **Delivery Status:** Completed, InProgress
- **Alert Status:** Active, Resolved, Acknowledged
- **Risk Levels:** Low, Medium, High, Critical

## ? What To Do Now

### 1. Start the App:
```bash
cd SafeRouteDashBoard
dotnet run
```

### 2. Check Console Output:
You'll see:
```
info: Starting database seeding...
info: Seeded 2 companies
info: Seeded 7 users
info: Seeded 5 drivers
info: Seeded 1 dispatchers
info: Seeded 13 deliveries
info: Seeded 9 panic alerts
info: Seeded 4 risk zones
info: Seeded 10 safety scores
info: Seeded 21 location updates
info: Database seeding completed successfully!
```

### 3. Open Browser:
```
https://localhost:5001
```

### 4. Verify Data:
- ? Dashboard shows KPIs with real numbers
- ? Drivers page lists 5 drivers
- ? Analytics charts display data
- ? Export CSV files work

---

## ?? View Seeded Data

### Using DB Browser for SQLite:
1. Open DB Browser
2. Open `SafeRoute.db`
3. Browse Data tab
4. Select any table
5. See seeded records

### Sample Queries:
```sql
-- View all drivers
SELECT * FROM DRIVERS;

-- View today's deliveries
SELECT * FROM DELIVERIES WHERE date(created_at) = date('now');

-- View active alerts
SELECT * FROM PANIC_ALERTS WHERE status = 'Active';

-- View risk zones
SELECT * FROM RISK_ZONES ORDER BY incident_count DESC;

-- View safety scores
SELECT * FROM SAFETY_SCORES ORDER BY overall_score DESC;
```

---

## ?? Expected Results

### Dashboard:
- KPI cards show real counts
- No "0" values
- Charts populated
- No empty states

### Drivers Page:
- 5 driver cards visible
- Status badges correct
- Filters work (Active: 3, OnBreak: 1, Offline: 1)
- Pagination shows "Showing 1-5 of 5"

### Analytics Page:
- Panic Alerts chart shows 7 days of data
- Risk Distribution shows 4 zones
- Driver Safety Scores shows 4 drivers
- Export CSVs contain data

---

## ??? Troubleshooting

### If No Data Appears:

**1. Check Console Logs:**
```
Look for "Database seeding completed successfully!"
```

**2. Check Database File:**
```
SafeRoute.db should exist in project folder
File size should be > 100 KB (not empty)
```

**3. Verify Tables:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM COMPANIES; -- Should be 2
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DRIVERS; -- Should be 5
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DELIVERIES; -- Should be 13
```

**4. Force Re-seed:**
```bash
# Delete database and restart
del SafeRoute.db
dotnet run
```
