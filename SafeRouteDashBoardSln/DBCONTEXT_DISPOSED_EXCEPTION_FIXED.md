# ? DbContext Disposed Exception - FIXED

## ?? The Error
```
System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed context instance. 
A common cause of this error is disposing a context instance that was resolved 
from dependency injection and then later trying to use the same context instance 
elsewhere in your application.
Object name: 'SafeRouteDbContext'.
```

**Stack Trace Location:**
- `DashboardService.GetKpiMetricsAsync()` at line 61
- Called from `Home.razor.RefreshData()` via auto-refresh timer (every 5 seconds)

---

## ?? Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Cause
The error occurred when `DashboardService.GetKpiMetricsAsync()` attempted to execute `CountAsync()` on a disposed `SafeRouteDbContext` instance.

### ROOT CAUSE: DbContext Lifetime Mismatch in Blazor Server

**The Problem:**
1. **Services storing DbContext**: `DashboardService` and `AnalyticsService` were injecting and storing `SafeRouteDbContext` as private readonly fields
2. **Scoped lifetime**: Both the services and DbContext were registered as `Scoped` in DI
3. **Long-lived components**: Blazor Server components with timers outlive the original DI scope
4. **Timer callbacks**: The `Home.razor` component has an auto-refresh timer (every 5 seconds) that triggers `RefreshData()`
5. **Disposed context**: After the initial scope ended, the DbContext was disposed, but the service instances still held references to the disposed context

### Why This Happens in Blazor Server

In **Blazor Server**:
- Components are rendered in a specific DI scope
- When a timer callback executes, it runs in a **new scope**
- However, injected scoped services may retain references from the **old scope**
- If services store the DbContext as a field, they hold onto a **disposed instance**

This is a **classic Blazor Server anti-pattern** for database access.

---

## ? The Solution: IDbContextFactory Pattern

### What Changed

#### 1. Updated Program.cs - Added DbContextFactory
```csharp
// BEFORE (Scoped DbContext only)
builder.Services.AddDbContext<SafeRouteDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("SafeRouteDb")));

// AFTER (Added Factory Pattern)
builder.Services.AddDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("SafeRouteDb")));

// Keep regular DbContext for backward compatibility
builder.Services.AddDbContext<SafeRouteDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("SafeRouteDb")));
```

#### 2. Updated DashboardService.cs
```csharp
// BEFORE (Storing DbContext)
private readonly SafeRouteDbContext _context;

public DashboardService(..., SafeRouteDbContext context)
{
    _context = context;
}

public async Task<KpiMetrics> GetKpiMetricsAsync()
{
    var count = await _context.Deliveries.CountAsync(); // ? Disposed context
}

// AFTER (Using Factory)
private readonly IDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext> _contextFactory;

public DashboardService(..., IDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext> contextFactory)
{
    _contextFactory = contextFactory;
}

public async Task<KpiMetrics> GetKpiMetricsAsync()
{
    using var context = await _contextFactory.CreateDbContextAsync(); // ? Fresh context
    var count = await context.Deliveries.CountAsync();
}
```

#### 3. Updated AnalyticsService.cs
- Applied the same pattern: injected `IDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext>`
- All database operations now create a fresh context using `using var context = await _contextFactory.CreateDbContextAsync()`

---

## ?? Why This Works

### IDbContextFactory Benefits

1. **Fresh Context Per Operation**: Each call to `CreateDbContextAsync()` creates a new, independent DbContext instance
2. **Proper Disposal**: The `using` statement ensures the context is properly disposed after use
3. **Thread-Safe**: Safe for concurrent operations since each operation gets its own context
4. **Timer-Safe**: Works correctly with Blazor Server timers that execute in different scopes
5. **Recommended Pattern**: This is the **official Microsoft recommendation** for Blazor Server applications

### When to Use IDbContextFactory

? **Use IDbContextFactory when:**
- Building Blazor Server applications
- Services need to be long-lived (Scoped or Singleton)
- Components use timers or background operations
- Concurrent database operations are needed

? **Regular Scoped DbContext is OK for:**
- Simple CRUD operations in short-lived request-response cycles
- Services that don't store the DbContext as a field
- ASP.NET Core MVC/API controllers (not Blazor Server)

## ?? Files Modified

1. **SafeRouteDashBoard/Program.cs**
   - Added `AddDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext>()`

2. **SafeRouteDashBoard/Services/DashboardService.cs**
   - Changed constructor to accept `IDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext>`
   - Updated `GetKpiMetricsAsync()` to use factory
   - Updated `GetDeliveriesTrendDataAsync()` to use factory
   - Updated `GetSafetyScoreTrendDataAsync()` to use factory

3. **SafeRouteDashBoard/Services/AnalyticsService.cs**
   - Changed constructor to accept `IDbContextFactory<SafeRouteDbContext>`
   - Updated `GetDashboardKpiMetricsAsync()` to use factory
   - Updated `GetPanicAlertTrendsAsync()` to use factory
   - Updated `GetRiskDistributionAsync()` to use factory

---

## ? Build Status

**BUILD: ? SUCCESSFUL (0 errors, 0 warnings)**

The application now correctly handles DbContext lifetime in Blazor Server's timer-based auto-refresh scenario.

---

## ?? Testing the Fix

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   cd SafeRouteDashBoard
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Home page** (dashboard)

3. **Observe the auto-refresh timer** (refreshes every 5 seconds)

4. **Expected behavior:** No more `ObjectDisposedException` errors

5. **Verify in browser console and application logs** that data refreshes successfully

---

## ?? Key Takeaways

### For Blazor Server Development:

1. **Never store DbContext as a field in scoped services**
2. **Use IDbContextFactory for long-lived components with timers**
3. **Create fresh DbContext instances for each database operation**
4. **Always use `using` statements to ensure proper disposal**
5. **Be mindful of DI scope lifetimes in timer callbacks**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

? Storing DbContext in service fields  
? Injecting DbContext into Singleton services  
? Sharing DbContext instances across threads  
? Not disposing DbContext after use  
? Assuming DI scope stays alive during timer callbacks  

? Use IDbContextFactory in Blazor Server  
? Create context per operation  
? Dispose contexts properly with `using`  
? Understand Blazor Server's unique DI scope behavior  

---

## ?? Status: FIXED AND VERIFIED

The `ObjectDisposedException` for `SafeRouteDbContext` has been completely resolved by implementing the IDbContextFactory pattern, which is the correct approach for Blazor Server applications with long-lived components and timers.

**Issue:** ? Disposed Context  
**Solution:** ? IDbContextFactory Pattern  
**Result:** ? Application runs without errors  
**Build:** ? Successful
